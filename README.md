# Contents

This is a collection of scripts and configurations (dotfiles) for things I use on my machines on a daily basis.
Things such as neovim, zsh, tmux and more, as well as some shell scripts for managing the installation.
The configurations are installed in the user's home directory using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

# Installing

Simply run `./scripts/install.sh`.
