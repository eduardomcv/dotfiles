This is a collection of scripts and configurations (dotfiles) for things I use on my machines on a daily basis.
Things such as neovim, zsh, tmux and more, as well as some shell scripts for managing the installation.
The dotfiles themselves are installed in the user's home directory via symlink farm, using GNU Stow.

# Installing

Simply run `./scripts/install.sh`.
